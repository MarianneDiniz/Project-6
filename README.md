# Project-6
#  Introduction
Pokémon Go is a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game developed by Niantic that can be downloaded for iOS or Android. The game works by using phone's GPS for real-world location and augmented reality in order to bring up on the screen virtual creatures, called Pokémon. Basically, the main purpose is locate, capture, battle, and train the Pokémons.

# Objectives
Using a dataset available at Kaggle the project aims to analyze the probability of a type of Pokémon appears on a given location. The mathematical methodology consists of k-nearest neighbors.

# Conclusion
Based on the results obtained by applying k-nearst neighbour, we can note that the possibility of a Super Rare Pokémon shows up in Natal/RN is almost null. The most common ones are the classes common and rare. Additionally, it is possible to verify that k-nearest neighbor algorithm works well to predict values.
